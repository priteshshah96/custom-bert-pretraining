      "Rolls-Royce is embracing its dark side. The British automaker is on a quest to expand its bespoke offerings, and the Black Badge cars are part of this journey. Now there's a handful of new members in the group and you can refer to them as the Adamas Collection.\n",
      "There will be 40 Wraiths and 30 Dawns that receive the Adamas treatment. What that entails is a whole lot of darkness, and the results are stunning. Right away you'll find a Spirit of Ecstasy that's not the shining example of luxury you expect to find. Instead, the lovely lady has been machined from carbon fiber. This is the first time that Rolls has ever crafted its iconic leading woman in the light yet strong material. She's comprised of 294 layers of aerospace grade carbon fiber and it takes 68 hours for her form to take shape.\n",
      "The main tone is black for the exterior skin as well, but the cars are finished with either an Aphrodite Red or Morpheus Blue contrasting hue. Once you step into the cabin, the darkness continues to envelop the soul of this Goodwood-built machine. Rolls-Royce has utilized laboratory diamonds to coddle the Black Badge infinity symbol inside the car. Overhead you'll find 1,340 fiberoptic lights to create another diamond pattern. For the first time, the overhead lamps use graded intensity that shades or highlights the pattern presented overhead.\n",
      "A final luxurious touch occurs when one enters or exits the car. An illuminated sill plate reminds the owner that their vehicle is one of 30 or 40, depending on which model they've chosen.\n",
      "As more and more premium and luxury features filter down to vehicles within the means of the proletariat, it's up to Rolls-Royce to continually push the true luxury bar ever higher. The Adamas Collection cars do that, and they do so with a delightfully sinister air.\n",

      "A San Bernardino man is behind bars after investigators said he sexually abused a 14-year-old and had an incestuous relationship with a family member, according to court records.\n",
      "David Kenneth Detjen, 47, was arrested Feb. 13 at this home in a cul de sac on Anson Street near Pacific Street and Del Rosa Avenue. He was booked and charged on suspicion of lewd acts with a child age 14 and incest for a sexual relationship with a 22-year-old family member, according to the criminal complaint filed in San Bernardino Superior court. The complaint did not identify the exact relationship between Detjen and the 22-year-old nor his connection to the 14-year-old.\n",
      "Detjen’s wife, Rebecca Sue Detjen, was arrested a few days prior on Feb. 10, and charged with suspicion of felony child abuse. Authorities did not comment how the incidents may be related, but the husband and wife were both listed in the same criminal complaint. The complaint did show the victim, only identified as Jane Doe, who was reported sexually abused by David Detjen has the same birthdate as the Jane Doe allegedly physically abused by Rebecca Detjen.\n",
      "San Bernardino County Sheriff’s investigators made the arrest, but details of the crimes were not immediately available.\n",
      "The couple pleaded not guilty to all charges Feb. 14 via video arraignment, court records show. They are expected to be back in court Tuesday for a hearing.\n",
      "A couple with the same names and birthdates as the Detjens was arrested in Indiana in 2012 for trying to drive from Pennsylvania to San Bernardino with five of their seven children and 18-caged cats in the back of a moving truck.\n",
      "According to USA Today, They family was struggling and didn’t have a car. They rented the truck in an effort to follow up on a possible job in San Bernardino.\n",
      "A family member in Pennsylvania called police to report the couple, worried for the children’s safety.\n",
      "According to Indiana State Police reports from the time, the children in the back of the truck ranged in age from 9 to 18.. A 14-year-old and a 15-year-old rode in the cab with the parents.\n",
      "Authorities said temperatures at the time of their arrest were below freezing, and although the children all had heavy clothing and sleeping bags, it was still extremely cold.\n",
      "In that case, the couple was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to neglect charges.\n",
      "The Detjens are currently being held at West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga.\n",

      "Senator and Republican incumbent Ted Cruz is leading his Democrat opponent U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke in the race for Texas Senate, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released Wednesday.\n",
      "In April, results from the same independent polling center had Cruz leading by only 3 points — 47 percent to 44 percent.\n",
      "The polling center called these results “too close to call.”\n",
      "“Democrats have had a target on Sen. Ted Cruz’s back, and they may be hitting the mark. Once expected to ‘cruise’ to reelection, the incumbent is in a tight race with Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke,” Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll, said in a statement.\n",
      "Now, almost exactly one month later, the poll results show Cruz leading by 11 points — 50 percent to 39 percent. The Texas senator is also leading among women voters, at 44 percent to 42 percent, up from last month when O’Rourke led 47 to 43 percent.\n",
      "TRENDING: ‘Terrible President:’ Former ACLU President Attacks Obama on Free Speech Issues\n",
      "The poll found Cruz’s biggest boost from men, with a lead of 57-35 percent, up from 51-40 percent in April.\n",
      "The poll found Cruz to be universally known within the state, with 49 of Texans polled viewed Cruz positively, while 38 percent had an unfavorable opinion of him.\n",
      "“O’Rourke, on the other hand, is still relatively unknown,” Texas Tribune reported. “Thirty percent of those surveyed had a positive view of him, while 19 percent had a negative impression of him. Fifty percent of those polled did not know who he was.”\n",
      "“Sen. Ted Cruz, apparently benefiting from a nationwide Republican mini-move, has taken a solid lead in his reelection race,” Brown said Wednesday.\n",

      "“President Donald Trump’s Texas numbers also have climbed during those six weeks moving from a nine point deficit on job approval to an even split today. It is hard not to see a pro-Cruz effect there.”\n",
      "“Finally, U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s lead among independent voters has shrunk,” Brown added. “Sen. Cruz has improved his standing among some key groups, including independent voters, Hispanic voters and men.”\n",
      "As noted by National Review, Cruz’s lead among Hispanics is “is a troubling sign for O’Rourke, who has tailored his campaign around his advocacy for racial minorities.”\n",

      "DUBAI Feb 13 Standard Chartered will consider whether it can restart correspondent banking relationships with Sudan following the proposed lifting of U.S. sanctions, a senior executive said.\n",
      "Anurag Bajaj, who oversees the British-based lender's correspondent banking business, where it provides services for other banks, said the bank was reviewing the implications of last month's move by the outgoing Obama administration to unfreeze assets and remove financial sanctions in return for its help in fighting Islamic State and other groups.\n",
      "The sanctions relief will come in six months if Sudan takes further steps to improve its human rights record and makes progress resolving its military conflicts.\n",
      "\"How significant the unravelling of the sanctions are [in Sudan] we will look at,\" Bajaj, Standard Chartered's global head of banks, transaction banking, told Reuters.\n",
      "\"Our sanctions team will review it before taking a decision,\" he added.\n",
      "For Sudan, the resumption of correspondent banking relationships will be vital to turning around its economy, which has struggled since South Sudan seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country's oil output.\n",
      "But banks are likely to be cautious given the tougher immigration rules imposed by President Donald Trump on citizens from seven countries, including Sudan, that could affect the country's relations with the United States.\n",
      "Standard Chartered admitted in 2012 to breaking U.S. sanctions against Sudan, as well as Iran and Libya.\n",
      "Bajaj said Iran, which the Trump administration earlier this month imposed sanctions on following a ballistic missile test, remained off-limits for the bank as it was \"sanctioned.\"\n",
      "However, he added that while the bank had cut ties with some clients in other countries to guard against the risk of falling foul of rules on sanctions or money laundering, it was still only a \"minimal\" number in global terms.\n",
